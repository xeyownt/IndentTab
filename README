DESCRIPTION
This plugin allows you to use your normal tab settings ('tabstop',
'smarttabstop', 'expandtab') for the beginning of the line (up to the first
non-whitespace character), and have <Tab> expanded to the appropriate number
of spaces (i.e. like :set expandtab) anywhere else. This effectively
distinguishes "indenting" from "alignment"; the characters inserted by <Tab>
depend on the local context.

HOW IT WORKS
This plugin overrides the default behavior of the <Tab> and <BS> keys in
insert mode.

RELATED WORKS
- ctab.vim (vimscript #231) by Michael Geddes exists since 2002. It also
  offers global and buffer-local mappings, but uses a slightly different
  approach, does not handle comment[prefixes], instead has some
  filetype-specific stuff. It also remaps <CR>, o and O, and additionally
  offers a :RetabIndent command.

USAGE
The indent tab can be en-/disabled globally or only for a particular buffer.
    call IndentTab#Set( isTurnOn, isGlobal )
You probably want to define your own mappings / commands for that, or do this
for certain filetypes only.

<Tab>                   Uses normal tab settings at the beginning of the line
                        (before the first non-whitespace character), and
                        inserts spaces otherwise.
<BS>                    Uses normal tab settings to delete tabs at the
                        beginning of the line; elsewhere it also removes
                        "space-expanded" tabs as if 'softtabstop' were
                        enabled.
                        The exact circumstances under which the normal tab
                        settings apply are configured by the
                        g:IndentTab_scopes setting.
